# Updated CQC Equation

The refined equation is as follows:

\[
\frac{\partial G}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 G + \beta \rho + \gamma T + \nu R G - \kappa \frac{G^2}{1 + G^2} - \epsilon
\]

**Terms Explained:**
- **\(\alpha\):** Diffusion coefficient.
- **\(\beta\):** Matter density scaling.
- **\(\gamma\):** Thermal effects.
- **\(\nu\):** Spacetime curvature scaling.
- **\(\kappa\):** Decoherence rate.
- **\(\epsilon\):** Stabilization constant.

The equation is derived from a Lagrangian-based approach and integrates quantum state evolution, decoherence, and spacetime dynamics.

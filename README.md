# Canaway's Quantum Code (CQC)

This repository is a Python-based framework for exploring **Canaway's Quantum Code (CQC)**, a theoretical model for quantum state evolution under the influence of decoherence, curvature, and boundary effects. It provides simulations for both foundational quantum theory (e.g., phase collapse) and practical applications (e.g., quantum computing).

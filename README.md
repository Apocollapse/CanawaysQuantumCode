# CQC Scalability Simulations

This repository contains Python scripts and configurations for simulating scalability within the Canaway's Quantum Code (CQC) framework. The simulations are designed to explore the behavior of quantum systems under various scalability scenarios, including multi-particle systems and higher-dimensional arrays.

## Features

- **Multi-Particle Chain Simulation**:
  Simulates a chain of interacting particles, each evolving under decoherence control, noise, and feedback.

- **2D System Simulation**:
  Expands the simulation to a two-dimensional grid to model complex quantum systems like atomic arrays.

- **Noise Models**:
  Incorporates stochastic noise to simulate real-world environmental effects.

- **Adaptive Feedback Control**:
  Uses dynamic feedback to manage coherence and control collapse outcomes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CQC_Scalability_Simulations.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```
   cd CQC_Scalability_Simulations
   ```

3. Run the simulations:
   ```
   python simulation_script_name.py
   ```

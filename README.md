# Canaway's Quantum Code (CQC)
A Python framework for modeling quantum state evolution with decoherence, curvature, and boundary effects.

## Features
- **Diffusion Term:** Models wavefunction spreading.
- **Decoherence Effects:** Amplitude-dependent suppression of quantum states.
- **Curvature Contributions:** Spatial distortion effects.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Absorbing, reflective, or periodic.

## Installation
Requires Python 3.7+ with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- Optional: `scipy`

Clone or download the repository, then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
See `examples/` for sample configurations like phase collapse and tunneling suppression.

# CQC Quantum Computing Simulation

This repository contains a Python-based simulation and modular code for testing the Canaway's Quantum Code (CQC) framework in the context of quantum computing. It includes simulations of 2-qubit systems under the effects of gate operations, decoherence control, and dynamic feedback mechanisms.

## Features

- **Qubit State Simulation:**
  - Models two qubits in the Bloch sphere representation.
  - Demonstrates the effects of decoherence and quantum gates.

- **Gate Operations:**
  - Implements Hadamard and CNOT gates, showcasing quantum logic and entanglement.

- **Decoherence Suppression:**
  - Uses the CQC framework to manage qubit stability and coherence retention.

## Usage

1. **Download or Clone:**
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CQC_Quantum_Computing_Simulation.git
   ```

2. **Run the Simulation:**
   Execute the Python script to visualize qubit state evolution:
   ```
   python cqc_quantum_computing_platform.py
   ```

3. **Extend for Platforms:**
   The modular code is ready for integration with quantum computing platforms like IBM Q or Google Sycamore.

## Simulation Insights

The 2-qubit system evolves under the following conditions:
- Decoherence is managed dynamically using the CQC framework.
- Gate operations (Hadamard and CNOT) influence the state trajectory, demonstrating the interplay between quantum logic and coherence control.

# Quantum Computing Simulations

This folder contains applications of Canaway's Quantum Code (CQC) in quantum computing:

- **`cqc_quantum_computing_platform.py`:**
  - Simulates the evolution of a 2-qubit system with gate operations (Hadamard, CNOT).
  - Example usage:
    ```bash
    python quantum_computing_simulations/cqc_quantum_computing_platform.py
    ```

These simulations demonstrate CQC's ability to manage decoherence and stabilize quantum gates, making it ideal for integration into platforms like IBM Q or Google Sycamore.
